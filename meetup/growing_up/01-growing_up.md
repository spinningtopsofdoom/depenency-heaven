# Clojure has many affordances to mitigate these points of failure

!SLIDE

# Namespaces and Immutability

## Libraries do not overwrite each other functionality or data

!SLIDE

# Protocols and EDN

## Defined extension points that are not tied to the library

!SLIDE

# Data first

## Glue code is concerned with data transformations no mini language translation
### Only need standard library for glue

!SLIDE

# Addition based growth

## Moving to a new version of the library means all old functionality still works
### Grows in power the bigger then dependency tree

!SLIDE

# Allows for confident experimentation
## Enough talk, how does it work?
