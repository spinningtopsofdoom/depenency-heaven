# Clojure has many affordances to mitigate these points of failure

!SLIDE

# Namespaces and Immutability
<br />
## Everyone can have their own development space
<br />
## Using a library does not modify it

!SLIDE

# Protocols and EDN
<br />
## Defined extension points to hook into
<br />
## Extensions can be read without library

!SLIDE

# Addition based growth
<br />
## Old functionality is never erased
<br />
### Grows in power the bigger the dependency tree

!SLIDE

# Clojure only needs source code
## Allows consumption and experimentation as quickly as changes are made

!SLIDE

# Clojure CLI dependency tool
## It's super awesome, how do we use it?
